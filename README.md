</div>

Einstein for Developers (Beta) is an AI-powered developer tool that’s available as an easy-to-install Visual Studio Code extension built using CodeGen, the secure, custom AI model from Salesforce. The extension does not use customer data to train our LLM. 

Head over to the [Einstein for Developers Documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/einstein/einstein-overview) to learn more.

**Note**: Einstein for Developers uses generative AI, which can produce inaccurate or harmful responses. The output generated by AI is often nondeterministic. Before using the generated output, review it for accuracy and safety. You assume responsibility for how the outcomes of Einstein are applied to your organization.
