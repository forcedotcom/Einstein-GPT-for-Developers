# Agentforce for Developers

</div>

Agentforce for Developers is an AI-powered developer tool that’s available as an easy-to-install Visual Studio Code extension built using `CodeGen` and `xGen-Code`, the secure, custom AI models from Salesforce. The extension doesn’t use customer data to train our LLM. 

Head over to the [Agentforce for Developers Documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/einstein/einstein-overview) to learn more.

**Note**: Agentforce for Developers uses generative AI, which can produce inaccurate or harmful responses. The output generated by AI is often nondeterministic. Before using the generated output, review it for accuracy and safety. You assume responsibility for how the outcomes of Agentforce are applied to your organization.
