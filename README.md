# Agentforce Vibes

</div>

Agentforce Vibes is an AI-powered developer tool available as an easy-to-install Visual Studio Code extension. It’s built on Salesforce’s secure, custom `SFR model` and enhanced with premium third-party models. Together, these provide intelligent coding support while ensuring that customer data is never used for training. 

Head over to the [Agentforce Vibes Documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/einstein/einstein-overview) to learn more.

**Note**: Agentforce Vibes uses generative AI, which can produce inaccurate or harmful responses. The output generated by AI is often nondeterministic. Before using the generated output, review it for accuracy and safety. You assume responsibility for how the outcomes of Agentforce are applied to your organization.
