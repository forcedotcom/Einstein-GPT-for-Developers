# Contributing Guide For Einstein-GPT-for-Developers

This page lists the operational governance model of this project, as well as the recommendations and requirements for how to best contribute to Einstein-GPT-for-Developers. We strive to obey these as best as possible. As always, thanks for contributing â€“ we hope these guidelines make it easier and shed some light on our approach and processes.

# Governance Model

## Published Primarily for Issue Tracking and Release Visibility

The intent and goal of open sourcing this project is to have a central location to triage and track customer issues, and provide historical information about releases.  Development on the extension is done in a different repository which is not currently public. We will not be looking for or soliciting contributions to this repo.
